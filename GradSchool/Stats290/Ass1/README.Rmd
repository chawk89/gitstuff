Follow these instructions _paying full attention to details_ to get
proper credit.

- Due date: Jan 17, 2020, 23:59:00 hrs.
- R version 3.6.2 should be used for all exercises.
- Write your answers (text or code) into the chunks named
  `q_1a`, `q_2`, `q_4i`, etc.
- Do not edit or shorten this markdown/notebook file, or rename chunks.
- You may want to check that you can knit/run and preview the markdown
  files in Rstudio without error before you enter anything, and, after
  you enter your answers.
- Note that the file `totf.txt` must be in the same directory as the
  associated markdown `ass1-q4.Rmd`.
- You will submit only the completed `.Rmd` files only as your
  work on Canvas. Nothing else.
