Follow these instructions _paying full attention to details_ to get
proper credit.

- Due date: Feb 17, 2020, 23:59:00 hrs.
- R version 3.6.2 should be used for all exercises.
- You will need packages `tidyverse`, `jsonlite` and `xml2`. Install
  it if you haven't already done so.
- This problem set uses data and files provided to you. They are all
  expected to be in the same directory as this markdown.
- Fill in your answers into the markdown chunks named `q_1a`, `q_2a`,
  `q_3a`, etc. Where you are asked to name the resulting variable, do
  so.
- If you are unable to answer a question, leave the corresponding
  chunk blank, as in the original file.
- Do not edit or shorten this markdown file, or rename code chunks,
  named or unnamed, or modify `eval` options. If you want to
  experiment, make a copy.
- You may want to check that you can knit/run and preview the markdown
  files in Rstudio without error before you enter anything, and, after
  you enter your answers.
- You will submit the completed `.Rmd` files as your work on Canvas
  for questions 1-3.
