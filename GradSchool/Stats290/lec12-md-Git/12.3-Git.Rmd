## Behind the scene

Behind the scene, all that is happening is that a series of git
commands are being executed. 

For example, you could set up a bare repository on the GitLab website,
say `foobar`. 

Then one could have executed the following commands on the command
line.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
mkdir foobar
cd foobar
touch .gitignore
git init
echo "# foobar repo created by hand" > README.md
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin git@code.stanford.edu:naras/foobar.git
git push origin master
```

Here is the session on windows.
```{r, out.width = "800px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("manual1.png")
```

I can also check that this indeed worked on the GitLab website. 

```{r, out.width = "800px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("manual2.png")
```

Note, however, that GitLab makes the repository _private_ by default!
